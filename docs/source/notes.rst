Useful notes for Helicon
=====

1. When doing 3D reconstruction, the helical image should be aligned with the equator line. 
This is important for the denovo3D to work properly.

2. The handedness of the helical image could not be determined by the denovo3D properly. Thus, one can search either
the positive or negative twist, and then flip the image to get the correct handedness.

3. When adjusting the inputs with the slider, one can use left-arrow key / right-arrow key or A key / D key to precisely
adjust the slider after clicking the thumb of the slider.
