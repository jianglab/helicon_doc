Useful notes for Helicon
=====

1. When doing 3D reconstruction, the helical image should be aligned with the equator line. 
This is important for the denovo3D to work properly.

2. The handedness of the helical image could not be determined by the denovo3D properly. Thus, one can search either
the positive or negative twist, and then flip the image to get the correct handedness.
